### TL;DR; ###
Retrieves the maintenance status of the cluster.

### DESCRIPTION ###
Returns an object with one list of machines per machine mode.
For draining machines, this list includes the frameworks' responses
to inverse offers.  NOTE: Inverse offer responses are cleared if
the master fails over.  However, new inverse offers will be sent
once the master recovers.
